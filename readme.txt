My Scrabble game can:
Randomly select letter tiles for the player's hand from a data structure.
Enable drag-and-drop functionality for placing letter tiles onto Scrabble squares.
Identify and process the placement of letter tiles on specific Scrabble squares accurately.
Include at least two bonus squares on the game board for added strategy and scoring opportunities.
Tally scores, considering bonus square multipliers for placed tiles.
Allow players to play any number of words until they decide to quit or run out of tiles.
Clear the game board after each round to start fresh for a new word.
Refresh player's hand by selecting only the needed number of letter tiles after playing a word.
Keep track of the score for multiple words until the user chooses to restart a new game.
Implement drag-and-drop constraints, ensuring tiles can only be moved from the rack to the Scrabble board.
Allow repositioning of tiles from the Scrabble board back to the rack.
Enforce placement rules, requiring subsequent letters to be placed next to or below another letter.
Provide option for users to restart the game at any time for a new session.

I used Javascript, JQuery, and HTML/CSS for this project. Took inspiration from example projects to make colors change
depending on whether or not the word can be entered but couldn't get it to work. 

I'm pretty sure all of my features work from the testing I did. I also gave it to my roommate to play around with
it and she did not find any errors. If I had more time I would have liked to have made it check with the dictionary
so it could have full game functionality.
